# Goals

## Editor

- <del>I can type, edit and clear the text in the editor
- <del>the editor will show me where I have made a spelling mistake
- <del>the editor will show me where I have made a grammar mistake (stretch)

## Toolbar

As a user:

- <del>I can change the font of the text
- <del>I can change the font size of the text
- <del>I can change the text color
- <del>I can bold, italicize or underline
- <del>I can change the left/right/center alignment of the text
- <del>I can add hyperlinks to text

## File Management

As a user:

- I can give each document a title
- I can create new documents
- I can select a document to edit from my documents
  whenever a change is made, it is saved
- I can see what time, or how long ago, the last save occurred
- (Stretch) my documents are accessable any device once I log in

<b>UX Considerations</b>

- Make sure the user can clearly see what file or document they are currently editing.
